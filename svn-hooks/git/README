This is a git configuration and scripts to automatically mirror twisted's
svn repository to git.

# turns current directory into a git repository, and initializes it
# from the public mirror.
# @param revno: last mirrored svn version
./init <revno>

# fetch from svn and push to public mirror
# expects ./deploy-key to be a ssh-key with access to public repo
# i.e. add it to https://github.com/twisted/twisted/settings/keys
./fetch

# ssh script which uses ./deploy-key
./deploy-ssh

# Anybody who commits needs to be able to run the fetch script
# The following sudoers line should be the correct thing on wolfwood
%cvs-twisted	ALL = (git-mirror) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/env -i /svn/Twisted/hooks/git/fetch
